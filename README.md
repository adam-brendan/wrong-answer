## wrong-answer

Tired of getting the right answer all the time for basic arithmetic? This is the package for you. Simply pass wrongAnswer an integer, basic operator as a string (i.e. "+", "-", "*", or "/") and a second integer and you'll be pleased to see a value that is not the right answer.

## example

console.log(wrongAnswer(4, "+", 4)) will return a number that is not 8.
